##  Strands Letter Solver Helper BE

A simple scraper to fetch the words from the current NYT Strands game to feed them to my React front end in an attempt to create a soution tool for players who want hints.

This will eventually be a firebase function with a 24 hour cache as to only scrape the site once a day.

Technology used: 
* Puppeteer 

Deployed to a google cloud run. Runs in a docker container.
